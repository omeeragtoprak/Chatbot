# Garanti Chatbot Project

Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to automatically scrape the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section of any website, store the scraped questions and answers in JSON format as a dataset, and use this dataset to build a chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The chatbot enables users to ask variations of the scraped FAQ questions and provides the correct answer along with the intended question, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs.

As an example, this project includes a chatbot developed using the FAQ data scraped from Garanti Bankâ€™s website.
